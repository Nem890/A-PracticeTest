# Description
A+ Practice Test is a Python-based practice test utility specifically created for individuals in the process of obtaining their CompTIA A+ certification.

# Project Background
As I was practicing for the CompTIA A+ certification I realized there really wasn't any good offline resources for practicing besides good ole' pencil & paper. I started this project as a way for me to not only learn Python on a much larger spectrum, but to also solidfy the technical concepts of entry-level IT.

# Planned Features
* Large/seamless library of questions & answers
* Library of acronyms and their definitions
* 1 minute timer per question to solidfy the 1 minute rule (good habit to consider)
* Mark questions for review and store them in a bank to be retrieved later
* Type 'answer' during a question to get the answer and a brief description of why it's correct

# Development Stage
**Pre-Alpha**
